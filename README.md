# Simple Web Calculator

A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Purpose

This was my first GitHub project. I used AI-generated code to explore how GitHub works — pushing commits, and organizing files. I didn’t fully understand the code at the time, but it helped me get started.

> This project is for learning and experimentation only.
